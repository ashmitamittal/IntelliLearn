# IntelliLearn
Enabling informal learning online (e.g., music, cooking, languages)

In the HCI course project at UWaterloo, our team of four tackled the challenge of enabling informal online learning in areas like music, cooking, and languages. Our goal was to devise a mobile application solution that directly addresses real-world problems related to informal learning.

## Project Overview
Throughout the term, we:
1. Conducted user interviews to deeply understand the problem's context and discern the functionalities vital for the application's successful adoption.
2. Crafted and prototyped both low- and high-fidelity designs.
3. Evaluated the designs to ensure they met user needs and expectations.

## Project Outcomes

### High-Fidelity Prototype
Our cumulative work over the term resulted in a high-fidelity prototype, ensuring the features effectively address the problem, while also being user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
